# PROFILE IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

## ?? How to Add Your Profile Picture

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
1. Use the profile image you provided (the one with you in the blue shirt and green jacket)
2. Crop it to a square ratio (1:1) for best results
3. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
4. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

### Step 2: Replace the Placeholder
1. Navigate to the `Images/` folder in your portfolio project
2. Replace the file `profile-hero.jpg` with your actual profile image
3. Keep the same filename: `profile-hero.jpg`

### Step 3: Alternative Method
If you want to use a different filename:
1. Save your image in the `Images/` folder (e.g., `my-photo.jpg`)
2. Update the image source in `DefaultSimple.aspx`
3. Change `src="Images/profile-hero.jpg"` to `src="Images/your-filename.jpg"`
